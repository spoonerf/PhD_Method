# What is R Markdown?



* It's a type of file you can use within RStudio for making lots of different things:
    + Web pages
    
    + Word documents 
    
    + PDFs
    
    + Presentations (like this!)
    
    + Books (see [Hadley Wickham's book on Data Science](r4ds.had.co.nz))

# How does it work?

* To use it you need to install the 'rmarkdown' package. I'd also recommend the 'prettydoc' package for some customisation options.

* Similar to a regular R document except the code is broken up into chunks to which you can apply different options. For example, you can choose to execute a chunk of code but not to display it in the report by selecting the option 'echo = FALSE'

* Outside of the chunks you can do all sorts of things, such as headers, text explaining your code, pictures and links etc

# Knitting R Markdown

 * Once you have finished splitting your code up into chunks and adding explanatory text and pictures, you are ready to knit your document! (Ctrl+Shift+K)

# Publishing Online

If you knitted your R Markdown as a html document you will be able to publish it online.
